Process:
1. Make a folder then open it on VS Code
2. django-admin startproject DJANGO_COURSE
3. cd DJANGO_COURSE
4. python manage.py runserver
5. After that go this link: http://127.0.0.1:8000
6. python manage.py startapp myapp

7. Then you can add urls.py in your app and then write code in views.py and then connect it with main projects urls.py.
in main projects urls.py=
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include("main.urls")),
]
in apps urls.py=
from django.urls import path

from . import views 

urlpatterns = [
    path("",views.index,name='index'),
    path("v1/",views.v1,name='view 1'),

]
it's an example, you have to do it like this.

8. Then go to main projects setting.py write your app name in installed apps
9. Then create model as, how you like.
10. Make sure everythis saved then python manage.py makemigrations appname
11. Then python manage.py migrate 
N:B: Everytime you changed apps models.py you need to do process 10 and then 11.



*** Add list in database from shell.
1. python manage.py shell(*obiously from your projects directory)
2. from main.models import ToDoList, Item (main= appname)
3. t = ToDoList(name="Nahid\'s List")
4. t.save(), for saving this in database.
5. To see all objects, ToDoList.objects.all()
6. To find objects in database, ToDoList.objects.get(id=which number you want to find)
now add items on list:
7. t.item_set.create(text="got to null",complete=False) (*how many attribute you have in your item you have to write here)
8.  t.item_set.all(), to see all items
9. to find particular item,  t.itm_set.get(id=which number you want to find)


dynamic page linking:
example:
def index(response, id):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>%s</h1>" %id)

urlpatterns = [
    path("<int:id>",views.index,name='index'),
   

]

for filtering:
after repeating step-1 and 2 then,
10. t = ToDoList.objects
11. t.all()
for example
12. t.filter(name__Startwith="Tim") for int t.filter(id=1)
